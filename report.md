# Overview

Land Registry is one of the use cases that involve a lot of intermediaries to put trust in the system. The existing solutions in place are out of date. Tracking who owns which pieces of property is challenging when you have thousands of land records to maintain.

It is quite common to confront discrepancies within the paperwork such as counterfeit titles, forged documents and a complete loss of the record. Such situations lead to expensive court battles between conflicted parties.

The transparent nature of blockchain can make it possible to trace how property changes hands. Blockchain’s immutable, auditable and traceable features are enticing governments around the world to implement the decentralized technology in the land registry process.

# Existing Land Registry process

The process of land registration in any country is known to be a multistep process, since it entails the engagement of all stakeholders who will have a direct or indirect stake in the registration. The currently used land record title storage system raises major issues about data fraud, the security of highly sensitive data, and the risk of system failure due to natural disasters, such as the server used for data storage going down

## Challenges

- **The Involvement of middlemen and brokers**

  > Middlemen and brokers are an integral part of every big business as they know more about market offerings. Buyers and Sellers usually prefer to call them to build a full support team.As a result, buyers acquire a deeper understanding of the market and identify lower/higher prices for the transaction. Middlemen gather required information from traders, identify errors, interpret and facilitate the implementation of real estate transactions.Since real estate is big business, it involves a huge number of players, including brokers, lenders, intermediaries and local governments. It leads to additional costs, making the entire ecosystem expensive.

- **The increasing number of fraud cases**

  > There has been several cases of imposters posing as the seller of a property. If an imposter successfully pretends as a property owner, they may receive the full amount of after completion and escape with the funds.In many of the cases, both sellers and buyers were unaware of the fraud until discovered by the land registry as part of a spot check exercise.

- **Time Delays**

  > Land Registry takes a considerably long time to complete title registrations. There could be a gap of several months between completion and registration.Many legal problems can also arise during this long gap. For example, what if you have to serve the landlord’s notice to break a lease where property has been sold. Such issues can make the entire process delayed and buyers have to wait for a long time.

- **Human error/intervention**
  > Currently, updates to the land registry records are made manually and the accuracy of those changes depends on a particular individual. It means that the land registry is more vulnerable to human errors.Human intervention can increase the chances of errors in the land registry system.

# Proposed System

**A Blockchain based Land Registry Platform**. Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology and database that has the ability to completely address the problems that plague current systems. The basic and most important aspect of blockchain technology is that it is a decentralized network in which all data supplied by a single node are confirmed by all other available nodes, and only after a consensus is made can then the shared data be saved to the blockchain.

Blockchain technology offers decentralized environment that is reliable and secure. The process of the land management and title recording system is being used for storing land title facts and running the transactions that are intertwined in land titles. Since these records are sensitive, land management and title cataloging systems must be robust in order to prevent falsification, make these records available at all times, and, most importantly, complete these operations in a timely manner

The process of the land management and title recording system is being used for storing land title facts and running the transactions that are intertwined in land titles. As these records are sensitive, land management and title cataloging processes should be strong in order to avoid falsification, making these records available all the time, and more importantly, these processes should be completed in a very short span of time. The functionality of blockchain also considered a digital register. Blockchain-based land registry schemes use the same functionalities as sound land registry systems have. At the same time, blockchain knows that these assets are owned by that person and also at what time a particular transaction took place

# Blockchain

Blockchain was developed from bitcoin paper published by Nakamoto in 2008. It is a peer-to-peer network where all participants (peers) serve as a node and all the nodes hold the same information. Blockchain is a ledger dispersed publicly above a network that registers transactions associated bordered by other network applicants. Instead of relying on the single authority such as administrators that can forge the database, blockchain technology offers decentralized environment that offers robustness and security as well. Untrustworthy administrators can abuse this power. A normal database suffers from that issue which is the failure that occurs at a single point, and it makes them to depend much on backups if some failure occurs. Moreover, due to this failure if both, i.e., backups and an operating database are abused, it is catastrophic.

A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain, with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.

A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.

# Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (Abbreviation: ETH; sign: Ξ) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Among cryptocurrencies, ether is second only to bitcoin in market capitalization. It is open-source software.

Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Additional founders of Ethereum included Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph Lubin. In 2014, development work began and was crowdfunded, and the network went live on 30 July 2015. Ethereum allows anyone to deploy permanent and immutable decentralized applications onto it, with which users can interact. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide financial instruments which do not directly rely on financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks. This facilitates borrowing against cryptocurrency holdings or lending them out for interest. Ethereum also allows users to create and exchange non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are tokens that can be tied to unique digital assets, such as images. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies utilize the ERC-20 token standard on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for initial coin offerings.

# Smart Contract

A Smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need for trusted intermediators, arbitration costs, and fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions. Smart contracts are commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, and the smart contracts introduced by Ethereum are generally considered a fundamental building block for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications.

# Solidity

Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum. Solidity is licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0. Solidity was designed by Gavin Wood and developed by Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi, and several former Ethereum core contributors. Programs in Solidity run on Ethereum Virtual Machine or on compatible virtual machines.

# Why is Blockchain Land Registry Platform a right solution?

- Accelerating the Process
  > Middlemen involved in the land registry process hold information that you cannot access, or you might not have the license required to operate in a property transaction ecosystem.But the blockchain land registry platform can offer you a distributed database where anyone can record and access information without the involvement of any centralized authority.At present, the title to a property/land is just a piece of paper. You require to fill blanks in the deed, sign it, get it notarized for rubber stamping and send the documents to the government to transfer the property.The process looks too old and slow. However, creating a digital title with blockchain land registry platform can improve the process.With the blockchain’s potential to prove authenticity, homeowners can transfer the land ownership legitimately to the buyer without needing third-party verification.
- Reducing Fraud Cases
  > In today’s digital world, it is now possible for imposters to forge the documents and fake the title ownership with the editing software.Blockchain land registry platform will allow you to upload the title documentation to the blockchain network where signers can sign the document and other users can verify it when needed.By keeping an immutable record of transactions, blockchain can prove that you are the owner of the land title and prevent from forgery of documents.Therefore, it can be said that the blockchain land registry platform could serve as proof of ownership, existence, exchange and transaction.
- Bringing Transparency with Smart Contracts
  > There are only a few people who buy property directly. The process of loan or mortgage is comparatively slower due to administrative issues.But smart contracts can make the process simpler by automating verified transactions. With the blockchain land registry platform, you can create a digital, decentralized ID as a seller and buyer. Doing so would make ownership transfer seamless and quicker than the traditional method.As soon as the registrar confirms the transfer of land title, smart contracts trigger to update ownership for a new buyer and transaction corresponding to it gets stored on the blockchain.In this way, it is always possible to trace back the history of ownership records.

# Working

Stakeholders involved in the Blockchain Land Registry Platform:

1. **Buyer:** A person who buys the land and uses the platform to search the property, request access and interact with the seller and get the land title ownership.
2. **Seller:** A person who sells the land and uses the platform to manage properties and transfer land title to buyers.
3. **Land inspector:** A person who uses the platform to manage property requests, view reports, confirm and initiate the transfer.

### Step 1: Users register to the platform

Users who either want to sell or buy properties register to the blockchain land registry platform.

They can create the profile on the platform with details like name, government-issued ID proofs and designation. A hash for the identity information submitted by the users gets stored on the blockchain.

### Step 2: Sellers upload the property specifications on the platform

Sellers can upload properties’ images and documents on the platform and pin the land’s location on the map. The transaction corresponding to the seller’s action of listing the property details is recorded on the blockchain.

Once the property’s details are uploaded to the platform, it is made available to all users who have signed up as a buyer.

### Step 3: Buyers request access to the listed property

A buyer interested in any specific property can send a request to access its specification to the seller.

Sellers receive notification for property access requests. They can either deny or accept it by looking at the buyer’s profile.

Buyers can view the previous ownership records of the property and send a request to purchase it and initiate the transfer.

Transactions corresponding to the requests made by both sellers and buyers are recorded on the blockchain to ensure authenticity and traceability.

### Step 4: Sellers approve the transfer request and land inspector gets the notification

If the seller approves the land ownership transfer request, the land inspector gets the notification to initiate the transfer of property. Smart contracts trigger to provide land documents’ access to the land inspector.

After the land inspector verifies the documents, they schedule the meeting for ownership transfer with buyer and seller.

The meeting record is also added to the blockchain to solve property related disputes if occur in the future.

### Step 5: Land Inspector verifies the transaction and initiates the transfer

Land inspector verifies the documents submitted by buyers and sellers and adds the authenticated records to the blockchain land registry platform.

Sellers and buyers sign the property ownership transfer document in front of the land inspector on the land registry platform.

The signed document gets saved in the database and transaction corresponding to it is recorded on the blockchain.

The transfer is initiated and smart contracts trigger to send funds to the seller and title’s ownership to a new buyer.

### Step 6: Land Registry Document Validation and Authenticity

In case of any disputes, any authorized party can upload the signed land registry document on the platform to check its authenticity and validate it.

If hash generated after uploading the document is the same as that of the hash created at the time of signing the document, then the document is authenticated and no modifications have been made to the document.
